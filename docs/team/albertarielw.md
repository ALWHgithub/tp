### Project: HackAssist

HackAssist - HackAssist is a desktop app for helping hackathon team leaders manage project tasks more easily.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HackAssist can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Storage**: Allows storage capability for task list by facilitating conversions from and to JsonAdaptedTask (Pull requests [\#1]())

* **Storage Test**: Writes test for task list storage, increasing Codecov by ~7% (Pull requests [\#1]())

* **AddTask**: Allows user to add task to task list (Pull requests [\#1]())

* **EditTask**: Allows user to edit task in the task list (Pull requests [\#1]())
