### Project: HackAssist

HackAssist is a desktop application for hackathon project leaders to manage tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a UI for the task list.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view and manage their hackathon tasks. 
  * Highlights: Displays in the UI what kind of sorting and filtering is applied to the task list. 

* **New Feature**: Added a command to assign tasks to team members.
  * What it does: Displays which team member each task is assigned to and which task(s) each team member is assigned to. 

* **New Feature**: Added a command to sort the task list.
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort the task list by priority or deadline in either ascending or descending order.
  * Justification: This feature helps the user, who is a hackathon team leader, to identify which tasks need to be completed first.
