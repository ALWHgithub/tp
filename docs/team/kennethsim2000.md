### Project: HackAssist

HackAssist is a desktop address book and task management application used to better manage tasks allocation in Hackathons.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI). If you can type fast, HackAssist can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter a task by task category.
  * What it does: Allows the user to only display tasks of a particular task category.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can choose to display only tasks related to frontend, allowing the user to better focus on the task.
