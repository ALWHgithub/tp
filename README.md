* This is **an application to manage Hackathon teams**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * for Hackathon team leaders to manage and assign team members to various task
  * for Hackathon team leaders to manage overall project workflow


  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-f12-2.github.io/tp/)**.


This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative.
